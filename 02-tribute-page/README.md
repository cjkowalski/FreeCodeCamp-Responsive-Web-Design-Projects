# freeCodeCamp Project 02: Tribute Website

I have been following the <b> freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Program </b>, and the first project it assigns you with is to put together a form that is designed to gather feedback from users regarding their experience with the platform. It includes fields for users to provide their name, email, age (optional), current role, recommendation status, favorite feature of freeCodeCamp, areas they would like to see improved (via checkboxes), and a section for comments or suggestions. The form concludes with a submit button for users to submit their responses.
